##Errors

We changed some simple grammer mistakes in chapter 14 of the handbook:

Had a view comma mistakes that needed different placement

Needed to add parathenses to one of the sentences

We changed some a spelling error in chapter 5.2

From onscreen to on-screen

##Good Documentation

It is good to maintain good documentation, so that others looking at your code or at the document can easily manuever through it and make changes to the document as need be. Good documentation leads to easy access and easy collaboration. Ifyou practice good documentation you are able to better understand coding and how it works. 

##Learned from this Lab

I learned how to checkout a file from online and change errors found on it. This is quite interesting and guides my understanding up open source projects all together.
